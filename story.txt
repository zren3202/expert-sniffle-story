Their servants brought them breakfast, lunch, and dinner everyday.
 Ariel was very good at making the best italian food they had ever tasted.
Ariel's specialty was creating his own noodles and sauce to make his spaghetti
exquisite. With spaghetti he liked to serve bread rolls to compliment the spaghetti.
Meanwhile, Caliban was very exquisite at making the best breakfast food.
Caliban was trained to make pastries filled with anything people wanted.

However, this day something went wrong. Both of the servers were not in the be
st mood. As a result, guests didn't really like neither Calioban's breakfast, 
nor Ariel's Italian food. Having listened to the guests not being amazed by 
the food, Prospero was furious. So, he went ta have a talk with both Ariel and
Caliban. He was so angry that he wanted to punish them strictly at first.

Months went by peacefully and when the family grew accustomed to living on the island. 
Just as the king thought his family was safe, while staring at the distance, he notices a ship
heading towards the island. It was Antonio and he was here to kill the king!
