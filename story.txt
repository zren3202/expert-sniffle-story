Their servants brought them breakfast, lunch, and dinner everyday.
 Ariel was very good at making the best italian food they had ever tasted.
Ariel's specialty was creating his own noodles and sauce to make his spaghetti
exquisite. With spaghetti he liked to serve bread rolls to compliment the spaghetti.
Meanwhile, Caliban was very exquisite at making the best breakfast food.
Caliban was trained to make pastries filled with anything people wanted.

Months went by peacefully and when the family grew accustomed to living on the island. 
Just as the king thought his family was safe, while staring at the distance, he notices a ship
heading towards the island. It was Antonio and he was here to kill the king!
